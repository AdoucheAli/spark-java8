25/05/2015 16:37 OKohlbacher @swcarpentry @lgatt0 @theoneamit @ypriverol Yes, and that takes a while. 3 years per curr? More colleagues seeing the light tho every day.
25/05/2015 16:35 swcarpentry @lgatt0 @okohlbacher @theoneamit @ypriverol Adding to the curriculum only works if you have consensus on what to take out to make room…
25/05/2015 15:42 lgatt0 @OKohlbacher @theoneamit @ypriverol @swcarpentry sure, that's part of the plan too. As well as courses in open scholarship
25/05/2015 15:41 OKohlbacher @swcarpentry @lgatt0 @theoneamit @ypriverol Disagree. I've been getting decent results for the last 10 years. Not always popular, tho.
25/05/2015 15:39 OKohlbacher @theoneamit @lgatt0 @ypriverol @swcarpentry Great, but not gonna solve the issue. Bioinfo classes need to be mandatory in bio curricula.
25/05/2015 14:53 swcarpentry @lgatt0 @theoneamit @ypriverol @okohlbacher Tried that in the 80s/90s, doesn't work. Plan now is train grad students &amp; wait 15-20 years…
25/05/2015 14:41 lgatt0 @theoneamit @ypriverol @OKohlbacher and let's not forget @swcarpentry are practicing volunteers, i.e. a community as opposed to top-down
25/05/2015 14:38 lgatt0 @theoneamit @ypriverol @OKohlbacher agree 100%, @swcarpentry instrumental in improving knowhow and appreciation of comp in science at large
25/05/2015 14:36 lgatt0 @theoneamit @ypriverol @OKohlbacher @swcarpentry also need to reach more senior scientists, who pull the strings of pubs, and more
25/05/2015 14:03 theoneamit @lgatt0 @ypriverol @OKohlbacher  I think @swcarpentry is doing a great job. But more frequency and outreach is needed.
25/05/2015 12:57 theoneamit @OKohlbacher @lgatt0 @ypriverol  true! This is the biggest bottleneck
25/05/2015 11:38 ypriverol @OKohlbacher @lgatt0 @theoneamit Agree, In my view is more twit, posts articles about it. Also we should try to promote comparison papers.
 25/05/2015 15:46 GPMDB @ypriverol @OKohlbacher @lgatt0 @theoneamit I agree, but in proteomics articles like http://t.co/mOEgazQQgj are acceptable to editors

25/05/2015 11:32 ypriverol @OKohlbacher @lgatt0 @theoneamit Well, Nature has been talking about open data for more than 10 years, still lot of research is not public.
 25/05/2015 11:35 OKohlbacher @ypriverol @lgatt0 @theoneamit Ack: Promoting it and achieving it are different things. Well be having fun with this for years to come.
25/05/2015 11:30 OKohlbacher @lgatt0 @ypriverol @theoneamit Training is key. Most life scientists had not training in data sci. Even bioinformaticians struggle with it.
25/05/2015 09:13 ypriverol @lgatt0 @OKohlbacher @theoneamit it is interesting because the consensus about data sharing is now strong, but nobody talk about software.

24/05/2015 17:56 lgatt0 @theoneamit @ypriverol @molcellprot to be fair, reviewing software/methods papers requires skills most don't have
24/05/2015 17:32 theoneamit @lgatt0 @ypriverol @molcellprot I agree, we need to change that. I always ask &amp; run on test data. Ask for link in paper, even if commercial
24/05/2015 17:28 lgatt0 @theoneamit @ypriverol @molcellprot I bet many reviewers don't bother.
24/05/2015 14:58 ypriverol @lgatt0 @theoneamit @molcellprot I suspect the manuscript agree, even if the data is free the code must be also free and reproducible.
 24/05/2015 17:18 theoneamit @ypriverol @lgatt0 @molcellprot some implementation shd b there- code/software binary-even if commercial. I doubt the reviewers didn't ask

18/05/2015 17:10 ypriverol @dctrudgian Well a resource without API is basically a Picture, an Snapshot of the original manuscript.
 18/05/2015 17:17 dctrudgian @ypriverol don't think so e.g. I can make great use of UniProt's ever changing data wo touching its web API, just downloading the 'snaphots'
18/05/2015 16:46 ypriverol An understandable way of reject a manuscript: "Dear authors your resource is nice &amp; looks relevant for the field but do not provide an API".
 18/05/2015 17:06 dctrudgian @ypriverol the way many bioinformatics APIs are I'd generally rather see the data in some reasonable downloadable format.
 18/05/2015 17:08 dctrudgian @ypriverol API a nice luxury. Most projects not actively maintained (funded?) in a way that supports delivering a stable bug free api.

09/05/2015 18:19 lgatt0 @theoneamit @ypriverol @dtabb73 indeed. But software (i.e users) can process data where ever it lives. 1/n
09/05/2015 18:10 ypriverol @lgatt0 @dtabb73 We are working on this API standars. the reason why we have lot of file formats is because that, and still creating more

09/05/2015 17:26 dtabb73 @theoneamit @lgatt0 @ypriverol Yes, I know quite a number of moody men.

09/05/2015 16:59 dtabb73 @lgatt0 @ypriverol I should be taking notes of this conversation for next week's NSF Workshop: "Mass Spec Data to Knowledge."
09/05/2015 16:58 ypriverol @lgatt0 @dtabb73 @theoneamit files can't support the millions of use cases of modern science.. APIs yes
 09/05/2015 17:20 theoneamit @ypriverol @lgatt0 @dtabb73 but then, not every researcher is a coder(wd a future requirement)
09/05/2015 16:54 GPMDB @dtabb73 @ypriverol And biologists like it because of the API and UI: doubt 1 in 100 know anything about the format itself
09/05/2015 16:42 lgatt0 @dtabb73 @ypriverol @theoneamit pwiz achieved that for many file formats. Would like this to be extended for any resource.
09/05/2015 16:41 lgatt0 @dtabb73 @ypriverol @theoneamit API defines how to make my resource useful to everybody
09/05/2015 16:40 lgatt0 @dtabb73 @ypriverol @theoneamit it's not API vs file. The point is that I should be able to ask same qst for data in files, online repo, ...
09/05/2015 16:26 GPMDB @dtabb73 @ypriverol Never met a biiologist that liked any file format that was not XLS, except maybe XLSX
09/05/2015 16:04 ypriverol @theoneamit @dtabb73 no agree in modern science one file format cant cover the # of use cases and needs... APIs YES
 09/05/2015 16:25 dtabb73 @ypriverol @theoneamit How could a conduit cover more use cases than the information resources it connects?
09/05/2015 15:55 theoneamit @dtabb73 @ypriverol agreed
09/05/2015 15:33 ypriverol @dtabb73 @bittremieux @GPMDB The new Pride Inspector allow s to viz mztab files
 09/05/2015 15:50 dtabb73 @ypriverol In my view, APIs serve other bioinformaticists, while file formats and user interfaces directly impact biologists.
09/05/2015 15:28 ypriverol @dtabb73 @bittremieux @GPMDB my strong felling is that we should move to standard APIs

 24/12/2014 14:20 GPMDB @ypriverol  The problem isn't the scoring function, it is the "FDR" interpretation of the target-decoy simulation.
23/12/2014 17:52 ypriverol @GPMDB Why?
 23/12/2014 21:52 GPMDB @ypriverol They realized that there was something wrong with the FDR interpretation of target-decoy sims,
 23/12/2014 21:53 GPMDB @ypriverol but rather than pursue the observation they went for a score-based kludge

15/11/2014 00:11 ypriverol @ProteomicsNews @UCDProteomics @GPMDB I'm now in NARITA airport but if you have problems let me know and I can do a deploy for you.
 21/11/2014 18:05 ProteomicsNews @ypriverol @UCDProteomics @GPMDB I think my problems are PC related.  3GB of RAM and 32 bit...I have a real PC Ill try at home.
14/11/2014 22:26 ypriverol @UCDProteomics @ProteomicsNews @GPMDB Let me know if you need any support. The scaffold export to mzIdentML is already there.
 14/11/2014 22:37 ProteomicsNews @ypriverol @UCDProteomics @GPMDB I'm downloading the inspector now.  I'm psyched to check it out on the plane.
14/11/2014 22:23 ypriverol @GPMDB @UCDProteomics @ProteomicsNews We can use the QC charts in Pride Inspector to see the results for those that don't have Scaffold ;)
14/11/2014 22:19 ypriverol @UCDProteomics @ProteomicsNews Can you make the data available in mzIdentML,would be great to see those results in PRIDE Inspector QC charts
 14/11/2014 22:21 GPMDB @ypriverol @UCDProteomics @ProteomicsNews You answered my question about the sample before I could type it in.
 14/11/2014 22:25 UCDProteomics @ypriverol @ProteomicsNews Wish I could...Hopefully soon. I'll have to check out PRIDE inspector..Thanks!

25/02/2014 15:15 ypriverol @IonSource  Trying to configure Mascot but always fail during connection. One complaint about PEAKS is the log system (really poor)!!!
 25/02/2014 15:18 IonSource @ypriverol I got to be pretty got at configuring Mascot. What does that mean, log system? (I am losing my battery, signing off)
 25/02/2014 17:13 IonSource @ypriverol Hello Yasset, Are you saying remote connection to PEAKS is poor? I liked Mascot because it was so intranet friendly.
25/02/2014 15:00 ypriverol @IonSource PEAKS is a great software. Actually I'm testing it and it works very well. I really like Inchorus!!!

14/01/2014 22:00 brianbalgley @UCDProteomics @ypriverol Agree, paper from Muddiman lab highlights need for very high mass accuracy for deamidations http://t.co/TAssVqpwKQ
14/01/2014 21:54 ypriverol @UCDProteomics @brianbalgley Last week we tested Peaks 7.0  (one dataset &amp; for PSM-FDR &lt; 1% we get Protein-FDR ~ 30%).Confusing 4 no-experts

14/01/2014 20:28 ypriverol @brianbalgley I agree with you 110%.
 14/01/2014 21:46 UCDProteomics @ypriverol @brianbalgley  Not sure I agree about deamidation. Yes it causes those problems, but including it = lots of real ids too
14/01/2014 20:04 ypriverol @brianbalgley Yes, Yes, but the point is if may sense at PROTEIN Level even for those Search Engines that past the Test.?
 14/01/2014 20:23 brianbalgley @ypriverol he is right: "no magic solution to recover information lost in a shotgun experiment" my point was use of "FDR" confuses the issue
14/01/2014 19:52 ypriverol @brianbalgley The post is about the significance of FDR at Protein Level and How we should address the Protein Inference Problem
 14/01/2014 20:01 brianbalgley @ypriverol right, but how do you get there from here if peptide FDR measurement is an issue? protein FDR must derive from peptide FDR, yes?
14/01/2014 19:45 ypriverol @brianbalgley Do you have a measure of how many publications are using now FPR instead of FDR?

08/01/2014 22:15 frapaport @notSoJunkDNA @ypriverol but for sure, I never use “bioinformaticist” and this word is painful to my ears.
08/01/2014 22:14 frapaport @notSoJunkDNA @ypriverol I think many people use “bioinformatician” ≈ technician and “computational biologist” ≈ scientist.
08/01/2014 22:12 ypriverol @frapaport @BioinfoTools @notSoJunkDNA @neilfws @attilacsordas @nterminus @BioMickWatson BTW in Spanish is Bioinformatico
08/01/2014 22:09 notSoJunkDNA @frapaport @ypriverol I don't think I agree with that distinction. I use Comp Biologist to emphasize "biologist with different tools"
08/01/2014 22:08 frapaport @ypriverol @BioinfoTools @notSoJunkDNA @neilfws @attilacsordas @nterminus @BioMickWatson even though b/c I’m French, I love to argue.

17/11/2013 09:36 BioInfoBrett @ypriverol @pathogenomenick @genetics_blog @BioMickWatson Readability -  code,  esp.  Bifo code,  is read more often than written
17/11/2013 00:36 mattdotvaughn @ypriverol @pathogenomenick @genetics_blog @BioMickWatson Because #perl has collapsed under its own weight &amp; we need a scripting lang
17/11/2013 00:09 benjaminlmoore @ypriverol don't get me wrong, I'd pick Python over Perl in each of those categories too
16/11/2013 22:58 bentemperton @ypriverol @pathogenomenick @genetics_blog @BioMickWatson all the power of BioPerl, but code doesn't look like a cat walked on keyboard.
16/11/2013 20:36 OmicsOmicsBlog @ypriverol @pathogenomenick @genetics_blog @BioMickWatson What deserving languages omitted? Haskell? LISP? Scala? #therespushineverypoll
16/11/2013 20:34 OmicsOmicsBlog @mkleen @ypriverol Easy - history. At time it became popular, Python &amp; R didn't exist. Still very useful language, if not as clean as Python
16/11/2013 20:10 dzanekmajta @ypriverol Three things:easy, fast-to-write, huuuge amount of already-done work eg. BioPython @genetics_blog @pathogenomenick @BioMickWatson
16/11/2013 19:46 mkleen @ypriverol Shouldn't the question be "Does anybody knows why perl is so popular in Bioinformatics" ?
16/11/2013 19:12 benjaminlmoore @ypriverol Easy for a biology graduate to learn?
